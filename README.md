# Name
Pitch Perfect (Bakery)

# Concept
Pitch Perfect is a rhythm game where you sequentially flip bread to first align them with the oven, and then make a strong kick to send it into the oven.

# Story
Learn to have perfect pitch in your bakery by efficiently making delicious baked bread with chocolate.

# Gameplay
- Flip count required before aligning the oven depends on the type of bread (large/medium/small) for example
- Flipping occurs when button is pressed and the a bread is more or less on the virtual bottom line (score given based on the accuracy)
- Kicking occurs when this same button is released and an aligned bread is on the virtual bottom line.

# Variations (optional)
## Difficulties
- White chocolate (easy, a bit slower and time window for points is increased)
- Milk chocolate (medium)
- Dark chocolate (hard, a bit faster and time window for points is reduced)
